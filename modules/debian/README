Notes to myself:

* We'll skip all of the kickstart stuff -- ksmain, kspkglist kspost
* copy all of the rootfs generated by debootstrap to location where the ks image gets mounted. -- during build
* Copy rootfs to fs-mnt -- during mount
* Discovered that signing uses preimage -- so pack all of our changes in mount
   50 -- cpy_tree2mount
   60 -- f
* make all of the chroot additions -- during preimage
* determine the size by using du on the tree -- during image -- overhead is 1.25 x du report
* try to get the sd generation routines to work as normally
